### Simple text-based adventure game project created as part of the 'Object-oriented Programming in Python' course from the Raspberry Pi Foundation. This free course is available online from FutureLearn at: https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/object-oriented-principles

This project consists of the following classes:
* a Room class to make interconnected rooms;
* a Character class, from which Enemy and Friend subclasses are derived;
* an Item class allowing items to be assigned to a room and used for combat.

In this game share, it is assumed that the user will create their own main.py
using the existing classes contained in Python_OOP_Game.
