When to use git:// or https:// URLs? 

For example,

https://github.com/HerbertAnchovy/FLcoding16.git
git://github.com/HerbertAnchovy/FLcoding16.git 

HTTPS is less likely to be blocked by a firewall.

and git//: ????

You need sage/git installed locally to allow commands like those below to work (TBC???)

In SMC project, goto New > Terminal. Then type in...

git init # creates .git local repo in SMC project.
         # See https://git-scm.com/docs/git-init.

git status # returns list of all files in project that have changed, and hence that are subject to next commit.

git add . # add files to index. git add * adds all files except 'dot' files. git add . adds all files.
          # See https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add.

# Need both of these otherwise you get 'Please tell me who you are' error.
git config --global user.email "info@phipps.myzen.co.uk"
git config --global user.name "HerbertAnchovy"

git remote add origin https://github.com/HerbertAnchovy/FLcoding16.git # Can't remember when I executed this line.
                                                                       # Needs it though.

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/HerbertAnchovy/FLcoding16.git # To change/rename remote url, if required.

git remote - v # Verifies the remote URL

git commit # Record changes to the repository. 
           # See https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit
           # However, in SMC, goes into a special COMMIT_EDITMSG mode, where 
           # it seems, you have to select which files to commit manually!
